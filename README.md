# Pangea Project

The original goal was to build a program/algorithm that would determine if all pieces of land are connected given a 2D array as a map with water symbolizied by "~" and land by "M".

Due to how much fun it was completing the original goal, the Pangea Project was born! This project aims to continue to provide the originally intended functionality along with a stable platform for features.

## Current Features
* Automatically generating map array
* Visual display of map (Canvas Blue/Green)
* Visual display of land connected status

## Planned Features
* Build all islands and provide their info

## Folder Layout
[Pangea Folder](/pangea) houses the current pangea project build using the [Google Closure Library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/) with the concept of Modularity in mind.

[Quick Folder](/quick) houses the original and quick completetion of the project with a few minor additions.


## Other Plans

* **Frontend/CSS** "It works... now make it pretty!"
* Make this a npm package
* Setup local development automation (Grunt/Gulp)
* Provide File CDN
